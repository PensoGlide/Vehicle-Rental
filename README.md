# Vehicle Rental - Smart Contract

This is a simple Solidity smart contract (built on version 0.8.0) that aims to emulate a decentralized system capable of providing any vehicle rental service to whoever from whoever.

This Smart Contract is based on the premisse that the vehicle has a unique *ID*. The vehicle's owner can then register this *ID* to a vehicle, detailing the brand, model, plate number (if it's a car or motorcycle), and, most importantly, an initial fee and hourly fee.

This Smart Contract can also append various events while the vehicle is being rented. These events could include overspeeding, abrupt stopping, an accident, or a vehicle malfunction. * ***Unfortunately, because there is no direct connection between the vehicle and this Smart Contract, this feature is limited to the client's willingness to provide this input.*** *

There is currently no frontend that allows for a more seamless experience with this Smart Contract.

## Usage

This section is applicable in both Remix or when running locally on your computer.

- For a prospective owner:

    First use the `addVehicle` function detailing the vehicle ID, plate number (if it applies, otherwise just leave it empty), the vehicle brand, its model, an initial fee in *Wei* (again, this is optional) and the hourly fee in *Wei*.

    In the case there was a mistake with the initial properties, the owner can always update with the function `updateVehicle`. To delete the vehicle from the database, simply use the `deleteVehicle` function. The vehicle details can always be checked with the function `getVehicle`.

- For the interested renter:

    The first step would be to use the `rentVehicle` function, specifying the vehicle ID of interest. During the renting of the vehicle, by using the function `getCurrentPrice`, the renter has the ability to check the current price for the rent (in *Wei*). 
    
    To return the vehicle, simply use the `returnVehicle` function with the vehicle's ID while making sure to provide enough *ETH* for the transaction.

    Due to limitations of the current Smart Contract, the event log to the vehicle must be made by the renter himself. The possible events are given by the functions `overSpeeding`, `suddenStop`, `accident` and `malfunction` for the cases of overspeeding, abrupt stopping, accident and vehicle malfunction, respectively. The only input for each of these functions is the vehicle ID.

## Testing

For testing *Web3* v1.6.1 and *Mocha* v9.1.3 are used, and a contract instance is created using *Ganache-CLI* v6.12.2 as our local test network. Unfortunately, I was unable to get a test contract deployment to work and, as a result, I was unable to formulate formal testing using this approach. The issue must be on lines 29-31 of `test/Vehicle_Rental.test.js`, but I'm not sure why.

Due to this, all my testing was made by hand on the Remix "*Deploy & Run Transactions*" interface itself.
